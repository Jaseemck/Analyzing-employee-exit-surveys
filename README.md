# Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys

In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. 

In this project we will be tackling the following questions:

   * Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
   * Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

## Getting Started

The code can be run on a jupyter notebook. The data are in csv format. App details from both the Google play store and Ios App store are taken.

The datasets used are:
* [TAFE exit survey](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey)
* [survey for the DETE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).
